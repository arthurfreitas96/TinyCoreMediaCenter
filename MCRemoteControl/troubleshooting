My NodeMCU board presented some issues through the implementation of the Media Center remote control.

First, all the board logic was inverted. All the digital pins gave output HIGH when ordered LOW and vice versa. To solve this
problem, it was necessary to invert all boolean variable logic in the sketch. That's what the InvMCRemoteControl sketch does.

Second, the board wont run the program after a shut down in the power supply. It was necessary to press the reset button in the
board to run the program again. I don't know if this problem was due to my power supply circuit. I used a MB102 board connected
to the grid by a 12v/500mA power supply. Regardless, this issue was solved connecting the RST pin to the 3V3 pin in the NodeMCU
board (source: https://www.esp8266.com/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=16516/). That way, the board resets every time that power is supplied
again.
